The tarred/zipped version of my working area that makes the plot.
Here are the instructions
1. Unzip/untar
2. Copy your text file with the info except for the first line (header) to this directory and name it "test"
3. python replace.py
4. python analyze.py

That's it. Item 3 replaces \t in your text file with space separation, and 4 just identifies the position
of the intersection in W'WZ coupling space and plots the result out.
