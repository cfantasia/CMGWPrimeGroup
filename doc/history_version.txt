02-MAY-11 (Christos), V00-02-38
===============================
(a) Data: processed all certified data so far (Run2011A_160404_163369)
  - SingleMu: 67.7 ipb
  - SingleElectron: 43.4 ipb
Skims (lepton-pt > 25 GeV) can be found under 
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/cleonido/wprime/V235/Data/

>>> IMPORTANT: Details in doc/README.txt <<<< 

(b) Allow analyses to deal with data root-tuples distributed over > 1
input files 

(c) Mu+MET analysis: 
o Added Spring 2011 ZZ-inclusive low-pt sample. All MC samples for Mu+MET
analysis can be found under  
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/cleonido/wprime/V235/MC_MuMET
(still missing high-pt tail of mu-enriched QCD sample and W- -> tau)

o muon-loop: skip muons with pt < 20 GeV (no real speed improvement observed)

o Cleanup of dump-high-pt muon method

(d) El+MET analysis:
o Disable hadronic recoil correction for now

o Cleanup of dump-high-pt electron method

(e) First version of plot-making macro (root_macros/plotMT.C). Good only
for Mu+MET analysis for now, must be made more flexible


30-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-37
===============================
Added Spring 2011 MC samples for Mu+MET analysis (still missing:
QCD-muEnriched-high-pt and ZZ-low-pt)

Misc: 
o Disabled hadronic recoil correction for W->mu samples till correction is
derived again with 2011 data
o Some more sites blacklisted in crab skimming files for Mu+MET analyses


28-APR-11 (David), V00-02-36
============================
bugfix: removeMCmatching accidentally enabled in skimming MC cfg files of
El+MET analysis 


28-APR-11 (Christos, Cory), V00-02-35
=====================================
1. Restructure of python cfg files in order to ease maintenance:
(a) In directory python (low-level files): 
 o patTuple_common_cfg.py contains common defitions (e.g. addition of
pfMET, event-content for trigger, pileup info,  etc); it is not called
directly from user/high-level cfg file 
 
 o patTuple_mumet_cfg.py and patTuple_elmet_cfg.py: files containing info
specific to mu+MET and el+MET analyses (e.g. aditional event-content to
keep; for the muon channel, the subset of pfParticles that needs to be
stored for the correction of pfMET when using TeV muon reconstructors);
this is where the call to patTuple_common is made. 
 
(b) In directory test (high-level files):
 o patTuple_[X]_[Y].py: high-level files for running muon+MET/electron+MET
analyses on MC/data. Depending on flags, MC info is in(ex)cluded, different
filters are applied on lepton-pt, etc.  
 [X] = elmet or mumet
 [Y] = data or MC_cfg_lowPtSkim or MC_cfg_highPtSkim


2. Added skimming CRAB cfg files for MC samples of  Mu+MET analysis
(directory: skimming_crab)


Misc:
3. Added pileup info in default PAT-tuple-making configurations
4. Reset event-counter when looping over multiple input files



25-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-31
=====================================
Allow each analysis to run on different input (MC/data) files (option added
in cfg file); Added customized samples_cross_sections files for Mu+MET and
El+MET samples.

Updated input files for 
o Mu+MET (24.67 ipb)
o El+MET (21.59 ipb)
analyses. See doc/README.txt

19-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-30
=====================================
First porting of Electron+MET analyzer. Follows design of Muon+MET code by
incorporating HEEP cuts for high-Et electron (package:
UserCode/SHarper/HEEPAnalyzer, V00-05-00)

Misc on Muon+MET: 
- remove obsolete/unused minimumPt cut
- minor tweaks to accommodate El+MET needs
- fix muon mass value :-) (interface/util.h)


12-APR011 (David, Christos), V00-02-20
=====================================
W + gamma (David):
o First porting of W(mu) + gamma analysis code. 


Mu+MET (Christos):
o updated data file (now at 19.30 ipb); available on castor (see
doc/README.txt) 
o config of PAT-tuple making: dropping all PFParticles but muons;
significant improvement in reading speeds (factor of ~10)


08-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-12
===============================
(a) Installation script: fixed typos in symbolik links
(b) PAT-tuple making:  default now is running on data (need to make
switching between MC&data a bit easier, but I am not sure how...)
(c)  Updated default data input file (Run2011A, 7.4 ipb); available on castor
(see doc/README.txt)
(d) Misc: removed protection against missing input files


05-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-11
===============================
Bugfix in installation script (macros/setup_Wprime.sh)


05-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-10
===============================
Changes to make code compatible with 41x (tested on/default working release: 4_1_4)

Fix compilation errors for 64-bit architecture

04-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-02
===============================

(a) PAT-tuple making: add pt>25 , |eta|<2.5 filters for muons, switch from
"clean" to "selected" PAT muons (test/patTuple_mumet_cfg.py)

(b) Analysis: add reco::Muon::numberOfMatches() > 1 condition in muon
quality definition 


23-MAR-11 (Christos), V00-02-01
===============================
PAT-tuple making for mu+MET: prune GenParticle collection to only include 
muons/electrons/neutrinos/W/W', plus, all particles from the hard matrix 
element 

Now using MC-truth info for W for correcting hadronic coponent of MET for 
mu+MET Mt distributions (HAS NOT BEEN TESTED: LACKING W SAMPLES!)

Currently missing/known issues:

(a) Mu+MET analyzer:
  o Need to retrieve HLT decisions; Edgar had done an excellent job when
running on RECO; not sure how to convert this code for running on
PAT-tuples (or if some HLT info is missing to start with)
  o Not all muon quality cuts have been implemented. This is basically
because I am uncertain how to retrieve this info, or whether the PAT muon
classes need to be (further) modified
  o Print/dump info for high-pt muons (ie. for debugging)

(b) Missing analyzers for El+MET, WZ, tb, ...

NB: I think I have a way of retrieving HEEP electrons from the original AOD/RECO file. 


11-MAR-11 (Christos), V00-02-00
===============================
Swithing to PAT formats (read README.txt for details). Work in progress. 

Currently missing/known issues:
(a) Need feedback on input collections and event-content for PAT-tuple
creation 

(b) Mu+MET analyzer:
  o Need to retrieve HLT decisions; Edgar had done an excellent job when
running on RECO; not sure how to convert this code for running on
PAT-tuples (or if some HLT info is missing to start with)
  o Need to store MC-truth info (just) for W, W', muons (plus, methods for
retrieving it). This currently affects the MET correction of W events
according to hadronic activity from Z->mumu reconstructed events.
  o Not all muon quality cuts have been implemented. This is basically
because I am uncertain how to retrieve this info, or whether the PAT muon
classes need to be (further) modified
  o Print/dump info for high-pt muons (ie. for debugging)

(c) Missing analyzers for El+MET, WZ, tb, ...
