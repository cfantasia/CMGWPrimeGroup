===============================
PAT-tuple making for mu+MET: prune GenParticle collection to only include 
muons/electrons/neutrinos/W/W', plus, all particles from the hard matrix 
element 

Now using MC-truth info for W for correcting hadronic coponent of MET for 
mu+MET Mt distributions (HAS NOT BEEN TESTED: LACKING W SAMPLES!)

Currently missing/known issues:

(a) Mu+MET analyzer:
  o Need to retrieve HLT decisions; Edgar had done an excellent job when
running on RECO; not sure how to convert this code for running on
PAT-tuples (or if some HLT info is missing to start with)
  o Not all muon quality cuts have been implemented. This is basically
because I am uncertain how to retrieve this info, or whether the PAT muon
classes need to be (further) modified
  o Print/dump info for high-pt muons (ie. for debugging)

(b) Missing analyzers for El+MET, WZ, tb, ...

NB: I think I have a way of retrieving HEEP electrons from the original AOD/RECO file.

===============================
Swithing to PAT formats (read README.txt for details). Work in progress. 

Currently missing/known issues:
(a) Need feedback on input collections and event-content for PAT-tuple
creation 

(b) Mu+MET analyzer:
  o Need to retrieve HLT decisions; Edgar had done an excellent job when
running on RECO; not sure how to convert this code for running on
PAT-tuples (or if some HLT info is missing to start with)
  o Need to store MC-truth info (just) for W, W', muons (plus, methods for
retrieving it). This currently affects the MET correction of W events
according to hadronic activity from Z->mumu reconstructed events.
  o Not all muon quality cuts have been implemented. This is basically
because I am uncertain how to retrieve this info, or whether the PAT muon
classes need to be (further) modified
  o Print/dump info for high-pt muons (ie. for debugging)

(c) Missing analyzers for El+MET, WZ, tb, ...
