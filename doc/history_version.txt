03-SEP-11 (Christos, Cory, Flavia), V00-03-00
=============================================
General improvements:
 - Corrections to pfMET due to dedicated TeV lepton reconstructors now applied
uniformly to both (high-pt) muons & electrons by saving pfCandidates in event
(electron-based analyses need to recreate pat-tuples with latest
configuration; analyzers remain backwards compatible when dealing with
older pat-tuples)
 - Now saving both L1 and HLT prescales in event (analyzers remain
backwards compatible when dealing with pat-tuples w/o prescale
info). Global tag updated to GR_R_42_V18::All to deal with latest trigger menus
- First version of hadronic-boson + W class (watch out CDF and Ken Lane!)


Muon/Electron+MET and W+gamma analyses:
- Now using BosonFinder class for constructing W candidates and applying MET
corrections 

Hadronic V + Z analysis:
- General updates, new data + MC samples
- First MC-data comparisons

Misc:
- TeV Muon class: users should check isValid before accessing kinematic
info; momentum returns dummy values for muons with null tracks. 
- TeV Muon class: isValid flag now set in ctor once and for all
- Added uniform treatment of MET corrections for lepton+MET signatures:
  o takes into account hadronic corrections and adjustments due to high-pt
TeV-muon/HEEP reconstruction 
  o returns "W" (ie. lepton+MET) candidate with full kinematic info
- Added configuration for jet selectors


18-AUG-11 (Christos, Cory, Flavia), V00-02-96
===============================================
Updated to latest set of PAT tags recommended for 4_2_5
environment. Adjusted modifications to PAT Muon class accordingly. 


16-AUG-11 (Christos, Cory, Flavia), V00-02-95
================================================================== 
General improvements:

01-AUG-11 (Christos, Cory, Federico, Flavia, Sunghyun), V00-02-90 
================================================================== 
o General improvements: 
  - First version of small/flat ntuples for El+MET channel
  - Common configuration for all W' analyzers
  (python/commonWprime_cfg.py) with baseline selector
  cuts. Individual-channel config files (under bin/) much simpler & more
compact now
  - Updated JSON files
  - Added macro for producing PU distributions for MC samples; Updated
  with latest distributions.for Summer11 samples
  - Implemented WP80 selection cuts for all electrons
  - Location of input (data + MC) samples documented in
doc/data_and_MC_samples.txt 


o WZ analysis: 
  - Added trigger emulation + trigger matching 
  - Utilities for efficiency, fake rate calculation 
  - Bugfix in delta-R matching 
  - Update samples
  - Moved quality cuts into TeV muon class
 
o El+MET analysis: 
  - "only-one high pt electron" veto now considers only good-quality electrons
  - Switched to WP80 selection cuts
  - Added list of triggers

isolation (0.10) cut as default 
  - Fixed location of PromptRecoV4 input files 
  - Improved printout information for high-pt muons
 
o Hadronic VZ analyzer: 
  - Fixed memory leak 
  - Fixed check on muon sign in Z finder
  - Selection cut restructuring
  - Extra plots

o Misc: 
- BosonFinder class: Added methods for returning full list of W candidates in 
event; added maxMassDiff method
- Added WPrimeUtil::runningOnData to determine whether current file under 
processing is real data 
- Changed some getters to const methods 
- Removed "using namespace std" from headers 
- Added "subdir" option in configuration of input samples in order to
be able to group them (according to run range, MC process, etc)



23-JUN-11 (Cory, Thiago, Christos), V00-02-80
=============================================

o Introduced "boson" finder (W, Z) in both lepton (+MET) and hadronic (jj)
signatures. Deals with adjustments to (pf)MET, hadronic corrections, etc,
high-pt reconstruction (HEEP, TeV muons) and provides W/Z candidates for
higher-level analyses. 

o Added pileup-weighting option for MC histograms.

o WZ analysis:
  - Now using HEEP electrons
  - Triggers updated
  - Isolation histograms added
  - PU-weighting added
  - Data and MC samples updated

o First version of hadronic WZ analyzer available


o Misc:
  - Updated pat-tuples for lepton+MET channels (see doc/README.txt)
  - Updated JSON files (golden, MuonPhys, DCS-only)
  - Mu+MET analyzer: fixed delta-phi matching between patMuons and PF muons
  - Added separate line in config files for determing integrated luminosity


30-MAY-11 (Christos), V00-02-70
===============================
o Have started necessary migration to 42x in order to deal with latest data
and MC samples: Code can now run on 42x (e.g. May10 ReReco/PromptRecoV4
data and Summer11 MC samples).  

NB: cannot combine PAT-tuples from 42x and 41x (e.g. May10ReReco data and
Spring 11 MC are not compatible) 

PAT-tuples with the latest data for Mu+MET and El+MET analyses available
(see doc/README.txt for details); Everything else: still missing


o Updated JSON files in config files for El+MET and Mu+MET analyses for
processing the latest 42x datasets  

o Mu+MET analysis now properly using updated TeVMuon class (default
algorithm was inadvertedly switched from cocktail to global muons...)



30-MAY-11 (Cory), V00-02-65
============================
General:
o First version of W and Z finders looping over high-pt leptons (ie. using
TeV muon reconstructors and HEEP electron ID). Need to migrate corrections
to MET here. 
o TeVMuon class now inherits from pat::Muon for a cleaner interface

WZ analyzer:
o general bugfixes
o updated list of triggers

NB: This version is compatible with 41x data and MC (e.g. Spring 11), not
42x. 


09-MAY-11 (Christos, Cory, David), V00-02-60
============================================
(a) First porting of WZ analyzer (source code, configuration, skimming
py files); brought to you by Cory Fantasia


(b) Added JSON directory with latest DCS-only, MuonPhys and golden
JSON files available. Have to be used by all analyzers now. 


(c) New skimmed (pt > 25 GeV) pat-tuples for SingleMu and
SingleElectrons datasets can be found at
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/cleonido/wprime/V250/Data/. 

The data has been processed with the DCS-only JSON file (231.97
ipb) to include maximum possible statistics. 
Analyzers should run with either "Muon Phys" (181.44 ipb) or
"golden" JSON (152.80 ipb) files, depending on whether they are considering
muons or electrons. See doc/README.txt for details.


(d) First part of high-pt tail of El+MET MC samples available at
/castor/cern.ch/user/d/dsperka/wprime/V235 


(e) Bugfix in pfMET-adjusting for TeV muon pt: make sure to return
original pfMET value when no dR-match between TeV muon and pf Muon is
found. Bug triggered by pfCollection containing no muons (hmmm...)
(NB: this has to go into some common piece of code, it
does not belong to Mu+MET analysis. Probably to be integrated within
W-finder class)


(f) Misc:
- Can now access multiple root-files per input-sample listed in
config/samples_cross_sections_*txt (see WZ analysis for example)

- Primitive attempt to integrate plot-maker for Mu+MET and El+MET
analyses (root_macros/plotMT.C); use "analysis_channel" switch. Should
probably implement something more sophisticated, but no time right
now.
 
- Mu+MET bugfix: was using DY->mumu in place of DY->tautau sample



06-MAY-11 (Christos), V00-02-50
===============================
New TeVMuon class introduced to deal with common TeV muon reconstruction 
across channels (e.g. Mu+MET or W->mu). It should be used for calculating:
- kinematic information (ie. pt measurement for dedicated TeV muon 
reconstructor)
- combined relative isolation (because it uses pt)
- "good quality" muon definition

Fixed #s of (some of) produced Spring11 Mu+MET samples (used to be taken from 
Fall10 twiki instead of DBS) 


03-MAY-11 (Christos, Cory), V00-02-39
======================================

- Fixed compilation error in src/EleMETAnalyzer.c

- Added SetDefaultSumw2 in bin/WPrimeAnalyzer.cc to properly take into account bin-content uncertainties in 
weighted MC  histograms. 


02-MAY-11 (Christos), V00-02-38
===============================
(a) Data: processed all certified data so far (Run2011A_160404_163369)
  - SingleMu: 67.7 ipb
  - SingleElectron: 43.4 ipb
Skims (lepton-pt > 25 GeV) can be found under 
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/cleonido/wprime/V235/Data/

>>> IMPORTANT: Details in doc/README.txt <<<< 

(b) Allow analyses to deal with data root-tuples distributed over > 1
input files 

(c) Mu+MET analysis: 
o Added Spring 2011 ZZ-inclusive low-pt sample. All MC samples for Mu+MET
analysis can be found under  
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/cleonido/wprime/V235/MC_MuMET
(still missing high-pt tail of mu-enriched QCD sample and W- -> tau)

o muon-loop: skip muons with pt < 20 GeV (no real speed improvement observed)

o Cleanup of dump-high-pt muon method

(d) El+MET analysis:
o Disable hadronic recoil correction for now

o Cleanup of dump-high-pt electron method

(e) First version of plot-making macro (root_macros/plotMT.C). Good only
for Mu+MET analysis for now, must be made more flexible


30-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-37
===============================
Added Spring 2011 MC samples for Mu+MET analysis (still missing:
QCD-muEnriched-high-pt and ZZ-low-pt)

Misc: 
o Disabled hadronic recoil correction for W->mu samples till correction is
derived again with 2011 data
o Some more sites blacklisted in crab skimming files for Mu+MET analyses


28-APR-11 (David), V00-02-36
============================
bugfix: removeMCmatching accidentally enabled in skimming MC cfg files of
El+MET analysis 


28-APR-11 (Christos, Cory), V00-02-35
=====================================
1. Restructure of python cfg files in order to ease maintenance:
(a) In directory python (low-level files): 
 o patTuple_common_cfg.py contains common defitions (e.g. addition of
pfMET, event-content for trigger, pileup info,  etc); it is not called
directly from user/high-level cfg file 
 
 o patTuple_mumet_cfg.py and patTuple_elmet_cfg.py: files containing info
specific to mu+MET and el+MET analyses (e.g. aditional event-content to
keep; for the muon channel, the subset of pfParticles that needs to be
stored for the correction of pfMET when using TeV muon reconstructors);
this is where the call to patTuple_common is made. 
 
(b) In directory test (high-level files):
 o patTuple_[X]_[Y].py: high-level files for running muon+MET/electron+MET
analyses on MC/data. Depending on flags, MC info is in(ex)cluded, different
filters are applied on lepton-pt, etc.  
 [X] = elmet or mumet
 [Y] = data or MC_cfg_lowPtSkim or MC_cfg_highPtSkim


2. Added skimming CRAB cfg files for MC samples of  Mu+MET analysis
(directory: skimming_crab)


Misc:
3. Added pileup info in default PAT-tuple-making configurations
4. Reset event-counter when looping over multiple input files



25-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-31
=====================================
Allow each analysis to run on different input (MC/data) files (option added
in cfg file); Added customized samples_cross_sections files for Mu+MET and
El+MET samples.

Updated input files for 
o Mu+MET (24.67 ipb)
o El+MET (21.59 ipb)
analyses. See doc/README.txt

19-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-30
=====================================
First porting of Electron+MET analyzer. Follows design of Muon+MET code by
incorporating HEEP cuts for high-Et electron (package:
UserCode/SHarper/HEEPAnalyzer, V00-05-00)

Misc on Muon+MET: 
- remove obsolete/unused minimumPt cut
- minor tweaks to accommodate El+MET needs
- fix muon mass value :-) (interface/util.h)


12-APR011 (David, Christos), V00-02-20
=====================================
W + gamma (David):
o First porting of W(mu) + gamma analysis code. 


Mu+MET (Christos):
o updated data file (now at 19.30 ipb); available on castor (see
doc/README.txt) 
o config of PAT-tuple making: dropping all PFParticles but muons;
significant improvement in reading speeds (factor of ~10)


08-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-12
===============================
(a) Installation script: fixed typos in symbolik links
(b) PAT-tuple making:  default now is running on data (need to make
switching between MC&data a bit easier, but I am not sure how...)
(c)  Updated default data input file (Run2011A, 7.4 ipb); available on castor
(see doc/README.txt)
(d) Misc: removed protection against missing input files


05-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-11
===============================
Bugfix in installation script (macros/setup_Wprime.sh)


05-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-10
===============================
Changes to make code compatible with 41x (tested on/default working release: 4_1_4)

Fix compilation errors for 64-bit architecture

04-APR-11 (Christos), V00-02-02
===============================

(a) PAT-tuple making: add pt>25 , |eta|<2.5 filters for muons, switch from
"clean" to "selected" PAT muons (test/patTuple_mumet_cfg.py)

(b) Analysis: add reco::Muon::numberOfMatches() > 1 condition in muon
quality definition 


23-MAR-11 (Christos), V00-02-01
===============================
PAT-tuple making for mu+MET: prune GenParticle collection to only include 
muons/electrons/neutrinos/W/W', plus, all particles from the hard matrix 
element 

Now using MC-truth info for W for correcting hadronic coponent of MET for 
mu+MET Mt distributions (HAS NOT BEEN TESTED: LACKING W SAMPLES!)

Currently missing/known issues:

(a) Mu+MET analyzer:
  o Need to retrieve HLT decisions; Edgar had done an excellent job when
running on RECO; not sure how to convert this code for running on
PAT-tuples (or if some HLT info is missing to start with)
  o Not all muon quality cuts have been implemented. This is basically
because I am uncertain how to retrieve this info, or whether the PAT muon
classes need to be (further) modified
  o Print/dump info for high-pt muons (ie. for debugging)

(b) Missing analyzers for El+MET, WZ, tb, ...

NB: I think I have a way of retrieving HEEP electrons from the original AOD/RECO file. 


11-MAR-11 (Christos), V00-02-00
===============================
Swithing to PAT formats (read README.txt for details). Work in progress. 

Currently missing/known issues:
(a) Need feedback on input collections and event-content for PAT-tuple
creation 

(b) Mu+MET analyzer:
  o Need to retrieve HLT decisions; Edgar had done an excellent job when
running on RECO; not sure how to convert this code for running on
PAT-tuples (or if some HLT info is missing to start with)
  o Need to store MC-truth info (just) for W, W', muons (plus, methods for
retrieving it). This currently affects the MET correction of W events
according to hadronic activity from Z->mumu reconstructed events.
  o Not all muon quality cuts have been implemented. This is basically
because I am uncertain how to retrieve this info, or whether the PAT muon
classes need to be (further) modified
  o Print/dump info for high-pt muons (ie. for debugging)

(c) Missing analyzers for El+MET, WZ, tb, ...
